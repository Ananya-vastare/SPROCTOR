## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python:**  
  The primary programming language for this project, chosen for its simplicity and versatility. Python's extensive libraries, like OpenCV and MediaPipe, facilitate efficient image processing and computer vision tasks.

- 🌐 **HTML:**  
  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the user interface of the application, allowing for the creation of forms, buttons, and other interactive elements that enhance user engagement.

- 📷 **OpenCV (CV2):**  
  An open-source computer vision and machine learning library that enables real-time image processing, allowing the application to capture and analyze video feeds during exams. OpenCV provides functions to detect and track objects, making it essential for identifying suspicious behavior in students.

- 🎥 **MediaPipe:**  
  A cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines. It is employed for facial and gesture recognition, enabling the application to monitor students' movements and expressions. MediaPipe's efficiency enhances the effectiveness of the proctoring system.
